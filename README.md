# ClickyGame

<!-- components-- might want to do .js .css and index.js where you put them together -->
<!-- your data is basically going to be an id and an image -->
<!-- shuffle cards -- use sort() to do this. -->

<!-- 
he made 2 arrays one for initial, and then you add images to already clicked [] onClick;


in the render, you map over function to put your cards on the page

?? Maybe put AOS on cards to make them more fun to look at??
